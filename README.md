# Crying at the Discoteque

Experiment for a rythm-puzzle-game made with unity. The player moves
their character across a dance floor. They need to make sure they don't
collide with other dancers. Everyone is moving on a beat. When the player
moves on the beat as well, they will be able to move more smoothly across the floor.

## What's inclued?

Very rudimentary level editor tools to set up the floor, walls, and the
dancers' movements.
